**Note: This library has been superseded by [blp](https://github.com/matthewgilbert/blp), the next iteration of pdblp.**. This library is no longer under active development.

pdblp
=====
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pdblp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pdblp)

This is a simple interface to integrate pandas and the Bloomberg Open API.
The standard Bloomberg API provides an extensive set of features for building
applications on top of however does not provide easy and interactive access to
data. This package provides several functions for accessing historical market
data and reference data. A simple set of examples is available
[here](https://matthewgilbert.github.io/pdblp/tutorial.html).

The library borrows heavily from a similar package available
[here](https://github.com/kyuni22/pybbg)

## Pinnacle's Fork

We add usage logging to monitor blpapi usage to prevent hitting daily or monthly limit.

## Questions

`pdblp` simply wraps `blpapi` responses into `pandas` dataframes, general
questions about `blpapi` **should not** be posted as issues. The best way to get
support for `blpapi` is either from Bloomberg directly via the terminal or on
Stack Overflow, using tag `blpapi` (and `pdblp` if it also relates to the `pdblp`
library).

## Requires

`python 3.x`

[Bloomberg Open API](http://www.bloomberglabs.com/api/)

[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)

and for `pdblp.parser`

[pyparsing](https://pythonhosted.org/pyparsing/) >= 2.2.0

## Installation

### Pinnacle's fork

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pinnacleinvestment/pdblp.git
```

### Pypi

```bash
pip install pdblp
```

or from conda-forge using

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pdblp
```

or you can clone this repository and pip install the package, i.e.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthewgilbert/pdblp.git
pip install -e pdblp
```

`blpapi` can be installed directly from the above link or you can install from
the `conda-forge` channel on Anaconda, e.g.

```
conda install -n blp_env -c conda-forge blpapi
```

If going this route make sure there is a build available for your version of
python https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/blpapi/files

If you are getting `'GLIBCXX_3.4.21' not found` error when attempting to import
`blpapi`, the following appears to resolve this issue.

```
conda install libgcc
```

## Documentation

The documentation can be viewed at https://matthewgilbert.github.io/pdblp/

### Bloomberg Documentation

For general documentation on the Bloomberg API check out the Developer's Guide.
For documentation on relevant Bloomberg fields for accessing data, check out
the Reference Guide: Services and Schemas. To access these, from a
Bloomberg Terminal go `WAPI <GO>` -> `API Developer's Guide`.

### Building the documentation

The documentation relies on [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
Building the documentation can be done by setting up a conda environment using
`conda create --name pdblp_doc --file doc-environment.yml`, sourcing this
environment and then installing the relevant version of `pdblp`. Documentation
can then be built using

```
cd doc
make html
```

and viewed in ./doc/_build. Before building this ensure that you are
logged into a Bloomberg terminal as this is required for building many of the
examples.
